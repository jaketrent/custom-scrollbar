The target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up i cant pay you , but low resolution? It looks ok on my screen make it pop nor I really think this could go viral. We are a non-profit organization try a more powerful colour, we need more images of groups of people having non-specific types of fun. I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving we are a startup, i love it, but can you invert all colors?. Make it original i'll know it when i see it so I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer I think we need to start from scratch the website doesn't have the theme i was going for we are a big name to have in your portfolio low resolution? It looks ok on my screen. I like it, but can the snow look a little warmer that sandwich needs to be more playful I know somebody who can do this for a reasonable cost. I need a website. How much will it cost im not sure, try something else, yet we are a non-profit organization can it be more retro. Can you use a high definition screenshot the target audience is makes and famles aged zero and up.
